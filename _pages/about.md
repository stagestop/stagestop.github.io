# ABOUT
Stage Stop Gun Shop is a firearm and archery retailer with two California locations, Mariposa AND Atwater. It is a family owned and operated business, conceived from a love of hunting and the belief in American’s right to bear arms. 

In 2011, Stage Stop Gun Shop found its first home in the historic town of Mariposa, California and a second location in Atwater, California was opened in 2013. In 2015, the decision was made to expand again but this time, the Verna Family decided to begin constructing a new facility in Atwater, California which would include an indoor shooting range, indoor archery range, classrooms, offices, and a VIP Lounge.  Land and the building were purchased and the planning began.  In 2017, construction officially began and in July of the same year, Stage Stop Gun Shop moved into the new location.
