# SELL or TRADE

## Turn your dusty old firearms into cold hard cash!

### Have an old gun you no longer need?

### Want some quick cash for your used firearm?

### Want to trade up to a new firearm?

We will make a cash offer for your used firearms on the spot, or we can accept it on consignment and post on our Online Auction service at GunBroker.com

### How does it work?

It's simple. Just call one of locations, (209-358-4867 for our Atwater location or 209-966-3777 for our Mariposa location) and our friendly staff will help you schedule an appointment with one of our appraisers.

Once you have scheduled a date and time to come into one of our locations, one of our apprasier will sit down with you to appraise the firearm(s) and make you a cash offer for your firearm(s) or we’ll help you determine a fair starting price for a consignment. Consignments are listed on <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/BI.aspx?IncludeSellers=2068753" target="_blank">GunBroker.com</a> and sell to the highest bidder.

### It’s Safe:
When you sell to Stage Stop Gun Shop, you legally transfer any firearm out of your name. For consignments, we protect your identity and act as the contact with the buyer. We store your guns in fire resistant safes while on auction.

### It’s Easy:
You bring in the guns, we do all the work for consignments and we mail you a check when your gun sells.

### It’s Legal:
We are bound by all Federal, State and Local firearms laws. So, by selling your gun to Stage Stop Gun Shop, it immediately is put into our inventory and is legally transferred out of your name. With consignments, we will ensure that the purchaser of the firearm is legally eligible to purchase it and we provide you with proof of transfer of ownership.

### It’s profitable:
We pay top dollar for used firearms. Consignments are exposed to the hundreds of thousands of potential buyers and selling via auction generates the highest price possible.
