This class is for a beginner shooter or for someone seeking a refresher class. This class is 4.5 hours long. In this class you will learn basic firearm safety as well as basic shooting skills. We will supply the firearm and the ammunition. The shooter may bring a personal handgun with ammunition. IT MUST BE UNLOADED AND PROPERLY SECURED. Time permitting, they may transition to their handgun under the supervision of an instructor. To register for the class, you will need to call or come into either location to pay for your spot. Please review the [class confirmation form](/pdf/2024-class-confirmation.pdf) “Class Confirmation.”

You will need: eye and ear protection. Low cut-cut shirts and open toe shoes are not allowed on the range. If you have not done so within the year, please sign [the waiver](http://www.smartwaiver.com/v/stagestopgunshop) prior to your class.
