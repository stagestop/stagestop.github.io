This class is 4 hours and is for individuals that have an expiring CCW.  We are currently certified to instruct residents of the counties of Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Stanislaus & the City of Turlock. Check back for updates regarding additional counties that may become available. In order to be registered for the class, you will need to call or come into either location to pay for your spot!

For this class you will need: ID, firearm(s) (max 3), 200 rounds of ammunition or at least 60 rounds per firearm, eye and ear protection, the holster you plan to use and at least two magazines per firearm.  No low-cut shirts or open toe shoes will be allowed in the range. If you have not done so within the last year, please sign the [range waiver](http://www.smartwaiver.com/v/stagestopgunshop) prior to your class.  Please review the class confirmation form ["Class Confirmation"](/pdf/2024-class-confirmation.pdf) and download and fill out the form [“CCW Serial”](/pdf/2023-ccw-serial.pdf) and email the completed serial number form to [train@ssgs.us](mailto:train@ssgs.us) at least one business day prior to your class.

For those individuals who have limited experience/range time, or just desire to increase their CCW base skill set, it is recommended, (but not required), that they attend the PRE CCW course.

For more experienced shooters, attending the Advanced CCW classes is recommended.
