We will have an employee dedicated to our VIP Bay that is assigned to your party exclusively.  He/She will go over all safety rules with your guests and assist with any needs during live fire. When you are ready, he/she will switch the party to the MILO system and  will run different scenarios for your guests to use. While live fire is going, there is to be no alcohol consumed by anyone in the party â€“ should you choose to bring alcohol, all firearms for all guests must be stored away in the owners vehicles prior to the alcohol being served and your guests will be able to still enjoy the laser fire MILO system for the duration of your party.
