In our 3rd bay, we have the Milo Range System.  Milo Range is a state of the art training system designed to evaluate your decision-making skills.  It uses interactive video scenarios to provide realistic training of use of force options and tactical judgement. Milo Range reacts to your reactions. These reactions determine the outcome of the training scenario. You also have a full library of CGI firearm drills and exercises to keep your skills sharp. You could be shooting zombies or balloons one minute and the next minute you could be in the middle of a live video scenario that can help be a more responsible [CCW](/training/#ccw-e) holder. You have the choice to use your own firearm with live ammunition or our laser simulation training pistol in all of these scenarios.
