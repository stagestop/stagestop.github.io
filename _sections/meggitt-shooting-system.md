Firearms training is about more than just shooting rounds down range. Itâ€™s also about accessing threats such as moving targets, friend vs foe identification and decision-making skills.  Our Meggitt system at first glance may seem similar to standard range retriever systems but it differs largely because it is programmable.  This system allows for you to run an existing program scenario or create your own for you and your group.  You could for example, choose to have the target move 10 yards and then decide if it is going to turn to be friend facing or threat (foe) facing and then move 5 more yards and decide again which face is going to show. This system is designed to help enhance your target identification skills.
